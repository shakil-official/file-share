# File-share
 

## Features

- file upload 
- file download
- file delete

Note : Any kind of file can be uploaded using that backend api. The cloud store isn't working properly because I can't test for potential. I utilized the cloud store api for the prototype.

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd file-share
npm i
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
npm start
